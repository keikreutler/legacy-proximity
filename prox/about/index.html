					PROX.IMITY.IO (Distant Early Warning) is a site gathering the first stage of research for works on astrological narratives of modern satellite technology and its mundane, personal, and geopolitical ramifications. Taking an experimental, ficitonal approach to the present, this project maps satellites visible in the sky over London back onto the Earth and begins speculating on what narratives they could trace.
				</p>
				<p>
					The project's past two months' research has focused on the historical origins, uses, and relevance of Western astronomy and astrology, alongside the development of space technologies and aesthetics. The Fragments page gathers notes, reflections and archival material from this process.
				</p>
				<p>
					Choosing three dates relevant to the Sputnik launch on October 4th, 1957 at 7:28pm, this site aggregates information on satellites' origins and current status. As for a cosmology of satellites, I am still undecided as to who (or what) precisely are the interpreter and the influced.
				</p>
				<p>
					This site will continue to catalog research and aggregate data on satellites, and expand its geographical and cultural focus, resulting in an ebook and film next year.

							This research began in response to thinking of satellites as an archival site of human existence, something that would endure long beyond our, and perhaps our planet's, lifespan. Whereas previous centuries' narratives of cosmology were entangled with cultural myths and strange chimeras, our contemporary ideologies aim toward Progressive technological solutionism&#8212;one man standing with a flag on the moon. Technologies taken for granted in parts of the world&#8212;data coverage, weather reports, and national and extranational infrastructures&#8212;rely on engineered forms with one, monolithic narrative and have little relation to varying scales of community and identity. In taking millienium-old ideas around cosmology and grafting them onto contemporary technology, it might be one way to use imaginaries of the present to direct the future(s).

							Until five hundred years ago, the division between astronomy and astrology did not exist within scientific inquiries into celestial bodies, though its study still had dissenters. The history of Western astrology is not fully ordained: having surfaced through Babylonian and Egyptian studies of cosmology, its application to the world took on varying forms: from chorography&#8212;the designation of entire geographical areas to one of the twelve zodiac constellations&#8212;to personal natal charts and forecasts&#8212;repopularized by newspaper horoscopes&#8212;astrology was first used primarily as a tool for communities to predict agricultural seasons and political upheaval through personal relationships with often iterant astrologers. The shift began as imperial court astrologers were deployed to support imminent victory or divine rights; at times the practice of astrology was outlawed completely.
						</p>
						<p>
							Astrology's contemporary manifestation, with its focus on the individual, distributed through mass communication channels, functions in the world much differently: after discreditation, it persists through app push notifications, newspaper sections, and <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=astrology+websites&client=ubuntu&hs=oL7&channel=fs&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=G3mJVZGOKqKX7QaK_7_gBw&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&biw=1366&bih=639" target="_blank">web sites</a>. Its origins point to uses relevant today, in predicting agricultural seasons, political and popular reform, and the desire to extend one's perception into the future. Most fundamentally, astrology's main tenet was the belief in the influence of celestial bodies on mundane, Earth-bound events.
						</p>
						<p>
							There are more celestial bodies today than ever, with estimates of 15,000 satellites in orbit, and nearly double that decayed, floating space junk. These bodies, satellites, in a very direct way influence our daily existence, from GPS services to weather reports, military communications to, increasingly, internet and data coverage. In certain ways, satellites give us the sensory perception we sought from the stars.

							Some are starting to claim we live amidst the second Space Race. This time around, rather than large governmental and tax-funded agencies driving the work, private space expenditures are appearing more and more feasible. Fueled by improvements in digital technology, excess venture capital that changes the deterring game of risk analysis, and an impetus from cultural narratives&#8212;surrounding both space travel for the rich and threats of a dying planet&#8212;a renewed interest in space technology has begun to surface.
						</p>
						<p>
							The second Space Race, which will in centuries perhaps become just another curious moment in space exploration's undertaking, revolves around differing anxieties and new geopolitical foundations. The launch of Sputnik in 1957 during the International Geophysical Year marked an interesting moment: the spectacle of launching an object into orbit sidestepped the question of national boundaries, and thereafter satellites would be allowed to hover, quite visibly, above extranational territory.
						</p>
						<p>
							Today, satellites are one of the technologies&#8212;alongside drones, balloons, and cables&#8212;being deployed in the race for global internet coverage. Corporations like SpaceX and OneWeb are competing for govermental contracts to launch fleets of satellites, while small startups like PlanetLabs use mobile technologies to iterate on satellite hardware at the speed of software development, able to cut losses due to the speed and decreased cost of production.
						</p>
						<p>
							Satellites serve an integral purpose in scientific, military, and personal spheres. They are the infrastructure upon which GPS, weather reports, and much of national communications still rely, while being incredibly vulnerable to <a href="http://io9.com/what-would-happen-if-all-our-satellites-were-suddenly-d-1709006681" target="_blank">disruption</a>. They are surveillance tools for international espionage, almanac-like forecasters for agriculture, and purveyors of omens on a changing planet.
